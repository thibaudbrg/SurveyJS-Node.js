# SurveyJS React & Node.js Express Application

This project is a comprehensive survey application built using SurveyJS with a React frontend and an Express backend in Node.js. It's designed to create, display, and manage surveys with a rich set of features including a survey creator interface, export functionalities, and comprehensive results visualization.

## Features

- **Survey Display & Interaction**: Users can participate in surveys with a dynamic and user-friendly interface.
- **Creator Interface**: Allows for the creation and customization of surveys through a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Export to PDF**: Surveys can be exported to PDF format, facilitating easy sharing and printing.
- **Results Visualization**: Display survey results in various formats including plots and tables for easy interpretation.
- **Export Results**: Results can be exported to CSV, PDF, and other formats for analysis and reporting.

## Getting Started

To get this application running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
- npm (Comes installed with Node.js)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thibaudbrg/SurveyJS-Node.js.git
    cd SurveyJS
    ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**

   Navigate to the backend directory and install the necessary packages.

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Backend Server**

   Still in the backend directory, start the server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The server will typically run on port 5001, but you can configure this in the server settings.

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

   Open a new terminal window. Navigate to the frontend directory from the root of the project and install the necessary packages.

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

5. **Start the Frontend Application**

   Within the frontend directory, start the React application.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   This will launch the application in your browser. If it doesn't automatically open, you can access it by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Running Both Frontend and Backend Concurrently

For convenience, you can run both the frontend and backend concurrently using the `concurrently` package. This has been set up in the frontend's `package.json` file under the script `dev`.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Usage
Creating Surveys: Access the creator interface through the applicationâ€™s main menu to start building your surveys.
Participating in Surveys: Users can access active surveys from the homepage and submit their responses.
Viewing Results: Analyze the survey results through the results page, where data can be visualized or exported.
